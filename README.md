"Learning the ropes" repository

Greetings Humans!

I have just discovered this new world of Github. I am about to start my very first repository with my current work, to avoid having to back up my code in mulitple places several times manually. This first readme is for me to learn the ropes with managing a github account.

Alas, I must be off now. Till next time!
